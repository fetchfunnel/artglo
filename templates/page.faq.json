            "Answer": "ArtGlo utilizes advanced LED technology in conjunction with a proprietary, patent-pending light-diffusing system designed by our part. Truly “set it and forget it” the LED lights within the sign automatically illuminate the entire design when the sun goes down, casting a radiant glow that allows it to be visible both day and night. The result is a stunning piece of illuminated art that can be personalized to your taste."

The signs are built with durable materials designed for longevity and safety. However, like any electrical product, they should be used responsibly. ArtGlo signs do not make good skateboards, frisbees, pitching backstops, or footstools."
